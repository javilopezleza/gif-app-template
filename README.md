# GifApp

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) and is intended for development with React. Below are detailed instructions on how to set up and manage the project.

## Before Install

To get started with this React project, follow these steps:

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: Includes npm (Node Package Manager), which is necessary for installing dependencies.
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**: Required for version control and managing the repository.

To check if Node.js and npm are installed, you can run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If these commands do not display version numbers, install Node.js from nodejs.org.

## Installation

Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/javilopezleza/gif-app-template
```

Navigate into the p`roject directory:
```bash
cd gif-app-template
```

To start the development server and run your React application locally:

Install project dependencies if you havenâ€™t done so already:

```bash
npm install
```
or, if you prefer using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```
Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
or:

```bash
yarn start
```
This command starts a local server at http://localhost:3000. The application will automatically reload if you make changes to the source files. You should see the React application running in your browser.
