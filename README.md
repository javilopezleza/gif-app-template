# GifApp

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) and is intended for development with React. Below are detailed instructions on how to set up and manage the project.

To get started with this React project, follow these steps:

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: Includes npm (Node Package Manager), which is necessary for installing dependencies.
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**: Required for version control and managing the repository.

To check if Node.js and npm are installed, you can run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
If these commands do not display version numbers, install Node.js from nodejs.org.

Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:
